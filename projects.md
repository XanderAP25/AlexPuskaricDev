### [Demystifying AI: A Guide to LLMs](https://xanderap25.github.io/Study-Site/)  
An independent study on modern AI models, completed in my senior year. I researched LLM architecture, in-context learning, fine-tuning methods, and AI ethics. The project culminated in fine-tuning a language model on *Grimm's Fairy Tales* and comparing its outputs against baseline models using zero-shot reasoning and text analysis.

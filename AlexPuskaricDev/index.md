I’m a Computing & Information Studies graduate focused on data science and machine learning. I enjoy working with data to uncover patterns, build models, and create clear visualizations that make complex ideas easier to understand. I’m drawn to projects where I can either make an impact or carry out an analysis that can lead to interesting and meaningful insights.

Here you’ll find my projects, resume, and ways to connect.

### [Demystifying AI: A Guide to LLMs](https://xanderap25.github.io/Study-Site/)  
An independent study on modern AI models, completed in my senior year. I researched LLM architecture, in-context learning, fine-tuning methods, and AI ethics. The project culminated in fine-tuning a language model on *Grimm's Fairy Tales* and comparing its outputs against baseline models using zero-shot reasoning and text analysis.

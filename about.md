My interest in data began at a young age with Pokémon. The stats, moves, and abilities added depth to the vibrant world I was exploring, sparking my curiosity about how data shapes systems. This fascination has followed me into adulthood, influencing my studies and personal projects focused on data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

After completing my independent study on AI, I developed a deeper respect for the field and now aim to take my skills further in that direction. Whether professionally or for personal research and enjoyment, AI is an area I’m excited to continue exploring.

Outside of data, I enjoy gaming, reading, watching anime, and running track. While my college athletics career may be over, I’m still passionate about running and maintaining an active lifestyle.
